I am the Training Team Lead at the [UK's Software Sutainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) committed to ongoing improvement of research software practice through training and community engagement work. I am advocating for openness, reproducibility, collaboration and inclusion in research. I volunteer in several open communities and serve on the Executive Council of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), an international community teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
